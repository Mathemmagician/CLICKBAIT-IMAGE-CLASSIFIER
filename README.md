# CLICKBAIT-IMAGE-CLASSIFIER

So far got up to the data labelling part. The project stagnated because:
1) Labeling thousands of images is boring. (1000/6000)
2) The clickbaitiness of thumbnails is somewhat difficult to assign due to the variance of topics
3) Clickbaitiness evolves with time. The data set used here is from 2017, which is actually different from 2020
